CITY-08 RESPONDENTS AHK SETUP TUTORIAL

Created by LusciousBeans

--------------------------------------



1\. Introduction

Hello to the Respondent who is reading this, welcome to my tutorial on how to set up C8R's primary AHK system. Follow the exact steps in here, and you should be good.



2\. AHK Installation

If you haven't already, download AutoHotKey from https://www.autohotkey.com/

**Make sure the version you are downloading is AHK 2.0, as that's what the system runs on.**

Click on the setup .exe file, and do the instructions there.



3\. System setup

You do not really have to touch the 'scripts' folder, but that's where the scripts will be stored. Double-click on any of them to activate them. On the system tray, you can exit out any scripts that you don't want anymore.



You do have to follow these steps in order to get a little keyboard overlay shortcut at the right top corner of your screen, though:

1. Go to the 'images' folder.
2. Grab the '\_ahk-keyboard-guide.png' and put into your users Pictures folder. (ex. C:\\Users\\YourName\\Pictures or C:\\Users\\YourName\\OneDrive\\Pictures). If you do not have a 'Pictures' folder in your user folder, create one.



You should be good to go to use the overlay.



4\. Enjoy. The following text will explain each of the scripts and what they do:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. location\_index.ahk

This script is responsible for replacing any default location names you may say (like plaza or nexus) into our codenames. So for example, if you were to type in: "plaza", it would immediately autocorrect to "HOTEL".



To toggle this, press F1. If you hear a high-pitched noise, that means it is active. If you hear a low-pitched noise, that means it is inactive.



2\. terminology.ahk

This script is responsible for setting your Numpad as a built-in terminology placer that makes you say standard faction terminology in the Roblox chat. Here's how to use it:



1. First activate it by double-clicking it.
2. In-game, press a numpad key and it will do all the magic for you.



We know that if your game is laggy, this script may not work as expected and it may be cut off.



If you want a detailed keyboard shortcut guide, look to the '\_ahk-keyboard-guide.png' image you saw earlier, or use the overlay script, which brings me to the third script:



3\. shortcut\_overlay.ahk

This script is responsible for displaying an overlay at the right top corner of your screen that shows you all the keyboard shortcuts for 'terminology.ahk'. This can be useful to memorize the shortcuts in-game. A known con of this is that it may limit your vision of rebels a bit.



You can change the size of the overlay in the script itself by using notepad. It should be self-explanatory on how to change it if you open it.

To toggle the overlay, press F10.
To completely stop the overlay from appearing anymore, press ESC.

That was pretty much it for the tutorial on how to use our system, if you have any questions or bug reports, report it to LusciousBeans.



In the meantime, have a good day!
